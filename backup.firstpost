I will finish my PhD in the summer of next year, but I suddenly realize I do not record any memories. I attribute it to be the reason that I am always busy and do not have time to do things like these. However, at this time, I do have some feelings of regrets. So, I decide to start blogging, as a way to memorize my life as well as sharing ideas. 

GitHub seems to be a good place to host blog. I searched a while for the tutorials on setting up a blog using Jekyll. I read and tried to follow some of these tutorials, and my blog then came to birth. I love the tutorial from http://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/, and the template here http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/minimal-mistakes/. A good Chinese tutorial: http://beiyuu.com/github-pages/.
