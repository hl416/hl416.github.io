Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of [my site](http://mademistakes.com)[^1] as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme --- I call it **Minimal Mistakes**, a responsive Jekyll theme with large featured images and solid typography. 

## This site is built to:

* Share ideas and experiences.
* Memorize my life.
