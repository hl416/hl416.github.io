$$E=mc^2$$ is a inline formula


$$ 
\begin{aligned} \dot{x} &= \sigma(y-x) \\ 
\dot{y} &= \rho x - y - xz \\ 
\dot{z} &= -\beta z + xy \end{aligned} 
$$

In [[time series analysis]], the '''moving-average''' ('''MA''') model is a common approach for modeling [[univariate]] time series models. The notation MA(''q'') refers to the moving average model of order ''q'':

:<math> X_t = \mu + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q} \,</math>

where μ is the mean of the series, the ''θ''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''θ''<sub>''q''</sub> are the parameters of the model and the ''ε''<sub>''t''</sub>, ''ε''<sub>''t''−1</sub>,... are [[white noise]] error terms. The value of ''q'' is called the order of the MA model.
